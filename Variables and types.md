## Hello World - (EDX introduction to Python for Data Science)
# 1. Variable Assignment
**Exercise:**
In Python, a variable allows you to refer to a value with a name. To create a variable use =, like this example:

x = 5

You can now use the name of this variable, x, instead of the actual value, 5.

*Instructions:*

*1. Create a variable savings with the value 100.*

*2. Check out this variable by typing print(savings) in the script.*

**Answer:**

```# Create a variable savings
savings=100

# Print out savings
print(savings)
```

# 2. Calculations with variables
**Exercise:**
Remember how you calculated the money you ended up with after 7 years of investing $100? You did something like this:

100 * 1.10 ** 7

Instead of calculating with the actual values, you can use variables instead. The savings variable you've created in the previous exercise represents the $100 you started with. It's up to you to create a new variable to represent 1.10 and then redo the calculations!

*Instructions:*

*1. Create a variable factor, equal to 1.10.*

*2. Use savings and factor to calculate the amount of money you end up with after 7 years. Store the result in a new variable, result.*

*3. Print out the value of result.*

**Answer:**

```# Create a variable savings
savings = 100

# Create a variable factor
factor=1.1

# Calculate result
result= savings*(factor**7)

# Print out result
print(result)
```

# 3. Other variable types
**Exercise:**
In the previous exercise, you worked with two Python data types:

* int, or integer: a number without a fractional part. savings, with the value 100, is an example of an integer.

* float, or floating point: a number that has both an integer and fractional part, separated by a point. factor, with the value 1.10, is an example of a float.

Next to numerical data types, there are two other very common data types:

* str, or string: a type to represent text. You can use single or double quotes to build a string.

* bool, or boolean: a type to represent logical values. Can only be True or False.

*Instructions:*

*1. Create a new string, desc, with the value "compound interest".*

*2. Create a new boolean, profitable, with the value True.*



**Answer:**

```# Create a variable desc
desc="compound interest"

# Create a variable profitable
profitable=True
```
