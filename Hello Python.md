## Hello World - (EDX introduction to Python for Data Science)
# 1. The Python interface
*Instructions:*

*1. Experiment in the IPython Shell; type 5 / 8, for example.*

*2. Add another line of code to the Python script: print(7 + 10).*

*3. Hit Submit Answer to execute the Python script and receive feedback.*

**Answer:**
``` 
# Example, do not modify!
print(5 / 8)

# Put code below here
print(7/10)

```
# 2. Any Comments?
**Exercise**: Something that Filip didn't mention in his videos is that you can add comments to your Python scripts. Comments are important to make sure that you and others can understand what your code is about.

To add comments to your Python script, you can use the '#' tag. These comments are not run as Python code, so they will not influence your result. As an example, take the comment on the right, just testing division: it is completely ignored during execution.
*Instructions:*

 *1. Above the print(7 + 10), add the comment Addition works too.*

**Answer:**
``` 
# Just testing division

print(5 / 8)

#Addition works too

print(7 + 10)

```
